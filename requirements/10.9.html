                                        <p>Georgia Highlands College (GHC) is a member of the University System of Georgia (USG) under the governance of the Board of Regents (BOR). GHC has cooperative academic arrangements for general degree credit and specific degree programs. These agreements allow GHC to transcript courses and credits for learning that has occurred through the cooperative program. GHC only undertakes cooperative academic arrangements that align with the mission of providing access to excellent educational opportunities for the intellectual, cultural and physical development of a diverse population; the purpose of providing access to a teaching and learning environment that prepares students to thrive in a global society; and the shared value of providing access to high quality, affordable educational opportunities within the diverse communities the College serves (GHC Mission and <span class="ws">Goals <a href="evidence/10.9/GHC-MissionandGoals.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[1] GHC-MissionandGoals">[1]</a>).</span> </p>



                                        <h3>Cooperative Academic Agreements </h3>

                                        <p>The college undertakes cooperative academic agreements to expand access to credentialed expertise and resources that would not be available to GHC students otherwise. The partnerships allow GHC to utilize courses that Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredited sister institutions in the USG have developed. Generally, there are of two types of agreements in place: those that allow for general credit toward any degree and those that are targeted toward specific degree programs. </p>


                                        <h4>General Degree Credit</h4>
                                        <p>
                                             GHC maintains two partnerships that allow students to take courses outside of GHC that the College transcripts as its own for credit toward general education requirements or special topics in any of the degree programs. These partnerships exist between GHC and sister USG institutions as part of the USG's eCore Initiative and the USG Goes Global Initiative. These agreements are reviewed, evaluated, and approved annually. </p>

                                        <p>The core curriculum for eCore primarily consists of courses required during the first two years of college and are generally applicable in any degree path. All eCore courses are taught entirely online, except for the occasional proctored exam. While not all the core curriculum classes are available via eCore, the remaining core classes needed by a student can be taken through traditional means at GHC (USG eCore <span class="ws">Site <a href="evidence/10.9/USGeCore-Website.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[5] USGeCore-Website">[5]</a>).</span>

                                        <p><strong>Specific Degree Programs</strong>. To offer courses that complete degree programs that the college might not otherwise be able to offer, GHC undertakes cooperative academic agreements with USG sister institutions. The USG facilitates the establishment of the MOUs with all parties involved. Currently GHC has five such MOUs which outline requirements for the review and approval of course content and faculty qualifications, the evaluation of the quality and integrity of course content and student learning outcomes, continuous improvement, and assurance of academic quality. These facets are reviewed regularly among all consortium members and are checked for congruity with GHC's mission. Each MOU establishes the responsibilities of each partner and establishes the members of a curriculum leadership committee for each program that maintains governance over the programs. GHC has a defined member on each curriculum leadership committee. </p>
