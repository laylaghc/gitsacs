                                        <h3>Full-Time and Part-Time Faculty at GHC</h3>
                                        <p>GHC is a teaching college with an access mission. As enshrined in the mission statement, GHC "provides access to excellent educational opportunities." The full-time teaching faculty are instrumental in meeting this objective. Teaching faculty are expected to engage in teaching, service, and scholarship/professional development, as stated in the expectations of teaching <span class="ws">faculty <a href="evidence/6.2.b/GHC-TeachingExpectations.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[6] GHC-TeachingExpectations">[6]</a></span> and teach a full load of 15 semester credit hours per semester. The expectation of service and scholarship/professional development are intended to be in service to the teaching mission of the college since the college does not have a public service nor research mission. Therefore, full-time faculty employment decisions are driven principally by GHC's teaching and access mission without consideration of a public service or research mission.</p>

                                        <p>GHC also employs part-time faculty members who are properly credentialed and teach courses on an as-needed, limited-term basis (semesterly) at the discretion of the institution. Part-time faculty members do not accrue time toward tenure and are not eligible for USG benefits. They work less than 19 hours per week and sign an agreement for each appointment, in lieu of a contract. This is consistent with the BOR and USG definition of faculty members at all state colleges and universities. BOR <span class="ws">3.2.1.1 <a href="evidence/6.2.b/BOR-Policy-3.2.1.1.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[7] BOR-Policy-3.2.1.1">[7]</a></span> states: </p>
                                        <blockquote>Full-time professors, associate professors, assistant professors, instructors, lecturers, senior lecturers, principal lecturers and teaching personnel with such other titles, as may be approved by the Board, shall be the Corps of Instruction. Full-time research and extension personnel and duly certified librarians will be included in the Corps of Instruction on the basis of comparable training. Persons holding part-time and adjunct appointments or other honorary titles shall not be considered to be members of the faculty. </blockquote>

                                        <strong>Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning</strong>. To assist both full-time and part-time faculty in their teaching duties, GHC has created the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. Staffed with a full-time director and instructional designer, CETL offers orientations such as New Faculty Academy (NFA) and Part-Time Faculty <span class="ws">Symposium <a href="evidence/6.2.b/GHC-CETL-NFA.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[8] GHC-CETL-NFA">[8]</a>;</span> workshops on a variety of topics such as regular substantive interaction, engaging online students, and grading the learning management <span class="ws">system <a href="evidence/6.2.b/GHC-CETL-Workshops.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[9] GHC-CETL-Workshops">[9]</a>;</span> and faculty learning <span class="ws">communities <a href="evidence/6.2.b/GHC-CETL-LC.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[10] GHC-CETL-LC">[10]</a>.</span> All of these are made available to full-time and part-time faculty members and serve to strengthen their involvement and pedagogy.

                                        <h3>Number of Full-Time and Adjunct Faculty Disaggregated by Program </h3>
                                        <p>GHC's educational programs are the degree programs offered by the college, as defined in the SACSCOC Resource Manual and listed on the Institutional Summary Form. For the purpose of demonstrating that GHC has a sufficient number of full-time faculty, data will be presented by school, by program, and disaggregated by both mode of instruction and by geographic location to show that the College has an overwhelming number of full-time faculty.</p>

                                        <p>Because the Associate of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees are so similar and share the same faculty and curriculum, those programs will be included on the same line. The AA and AS degrees are the first sixty-four (64) semester hours of a bachelor's degree. The data reflected in the bachelor's degrees represent only upper-level coursework.</p>

The college strives to hire qualified high school teachers who are credentialed by the same standards as college faculty to teach these courses. Dual enrollment students receive both high school and college credit for the completion of their work. Distance education courses are offered via the college and open to all currently enrolled students. Instructors teaching at instructional sites, at local high schools, and online are held to the same standards and expectations as instructors at GHC's campus. They are selected, managed, and evaluated by the academic dean and chair of each school. </p>

                                        <p>GHC maintains no formal policy regarding faculty members teaching courses more than 15 semester credit hours per semester. Instead, the need for course overloads is determined by the Division Chair and Academic Dean in consultation with the Provost and CAO. Should the need arise, up to two overload courses are offered to faculty members for additional compensation. Table 5 demonstrates the number of courses taught in overload.</p>

                                        <p>The data presented in this narrative provide a broad overview of the work of a faculty member at GHC. The College's focus, per the mission of the institution, is on teaching. Full-time faculty members teach a 15-semester credit hour per semester load with no formal research requirement. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the majority (greater than 50%) of teaching in each program is over 50% on average across the two years for all educational programs offered by the College. GHC provides full-time faculty the opportunity to teach overload courses as driven by student demand as determined by the Division Chair and Academic Dean. However, the overwhelming majority of courses are taught by full-time faculty within load. </p>
