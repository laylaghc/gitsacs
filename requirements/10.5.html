                                        Georgia Highlands College (GHC) is a state college in the University System of Georgia (USG). The College operates under the authority of the Board of Regents (BOR). GHC serves as a point of access to higher education in Northwest Georgia. GHC's admissions policies are in keeping with its mission and the policies and procedures set forth by the USG and BOR.

                                        <h3>GHC's Access Mission </h3>
                                        <p>The mission statement of GHC is as follows: </p>
                                        <blockquote>The mission of Georgia Highlands College, a state college of the University System of Georgia, is to provide access to excellent educational opportunities for the intellectual, cultural, and physical development of a diverse population through pre-baccalaureate associate degree transfer programs, career associate degree programs, and targeted baccalaureate degree programs that meet the economic development needs of the <span class="ws">region <a href="evidence/10.5/GHC-MissionandGoals.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[1] GHC-MissionandGoals">[1]</a>.</span></blockquote>

                                        <p>In addition to the mission statement, the BOR and USG describe expectations of the mission of a state college. Specifically: </p>
                                        <blockquote>Institutions included in the balanced bachelor's and associate-level state colleges group offer bachelor's degrees, associate programs, and general education courses, but no graduate programs. These state colleges are characterized as balanced bachelor's and associate-level degrees with bachelor's programs focused on specialized academic and economic development program areas and regional, college-educated workforce needs. The Nexus degree can be offered at state colleges. The emphasis at these state colleges is on teaching and service with limited focus on basic or applied research activity <span class="ws">(BOR 2.8 <a href="evidence/10.5/BOR-Policy-2.8.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[2] BOR-Policy-2.8">[2]</a>).</span> </blockquote>

                                        <h3>Admissions Department </h3>
                                        <p>Contained under GHC's Unit Mission Statements and Goals, the admissions department has its individual mission <span class="ws">statement <a href="evidence/10.5/GHC-AdmissionsMissionandGoals.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[3] GHC-AdmissionsMissionandGoals">[3]</a></span>. It notes:</p>

                                            <strong>Presidential Exception Provision</strong>
                                            <p>Each institution President or his or her designee may, under special and rare circumstances, grant exceptions to the above general Limited Admission provision if the applicant shows promise for academic success. Institutions shall use multiple measures, such as interviews, portfolios, and records of experiential achievements whenever possible.</p>

                                            <p>At least one of the following must be held for consideration under the Presidential Exception provision:</p>
                                            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                                                <li>A high school diploma from an accredited or approved high school as specified in BOR Policy Section<span class="ws"> 4.2.1.1 <a href="evidence/10.5/BOR-Policy-4.2.1.1.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[14] BOR-Policy-4.2.1.1">[14]</a></span> (certificate of attendance or special education diplomas are not acceptable).</li>
                                                <li>A state-issued high school equivalency certificate or diploma earned through the successful completion of the GED, TASC, or HiSet test. An applicant who presents a state-issued diploma or certificate is expected to be at least 18 years of age and for his or her high school class to have graduated; however, institutions may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Certificates of attendance or special education diplomas are not acceptable.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </div>

                                        <p>Applicants admitted under the Presidential Exception provision are included in the number allowed for an institution under the Limited Admission category.</p>

                                        <div class="not-blockquote">
                                            <strong>Applicants with Outstanding Scores</strong>
                                            <p>Institutions may grant admission to applicants who demonstrate very high academic ability by achieving a Total SAT or Composite ACT score in the upper five percent of national college-bound seniors for the most recent test year and who show other evidence of college readiness.</p>

                                            <strong>Admission of Students with Disabilities</strong>
                                            <p>Because the core curriculum of each institution requires students to complete college-level courses in English, mathematics, social science, and science, all students must complete the RHSC in these areas. Applicants with disabilities that preclude the acquisition of a foreign language may petition for admission without this requirement according to procedures established by the USG.</p>
                                        </div>

                                        <p>The access mission of the USG's State Colleges is upheld here since the percentage limitation on determining the number of Limited Admission acceptances at State Colleges is substantially higher than the percentages for the other three sectors by policy.</p>

                                        <p>In practice, GHC has used limited admission waivers. GHC's [Traditional Freshman Accepted] headcount for Fall 2022 was 1348. The limited admission provision was 17.8% of that number or 240 acceptances. GHC's use of the Presidential Exception provision was also rare. Only 12 applicants were granted admission as Presidential Exceptions for Fall 2022 and only six Presidential Exceptions were granted for Spring 2023.</p>

                                        <strong>Example Process: Presidential Exception</strong>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Applicants who do not meet minimum admission requirements for their applicant category are denied through normal GHC admissions processes.</li>
                                            <li>Denied applicants receive an email with denial decision, advising them to submit SAT, ACT or Accuplacer test scores to be used as a counterbalancing strength for reconsideration for a presidential exception admission decision</li>
                                            <li>If SAT, ACT, or Accuplacer test scores meet the minimum counterbalancing minimums(s), admissions processors make a first-tier presidential exception admission decision</li>
                                            <li>If SAT, ACT or Accuplacer test scores do not meet minimum counterbalancing minimum(s), first-tier denial remains in place</li>
                                            <li>Applicant has the option to appeal to the President for a second-tier presidential exception interview.</li>
                                            <li>The President will determine if the applicant has a sufficient support system in place, and an actionable plan for achieving academic success. If not, the first-tier denial remains in place. If so, the President sends an email to the Assistant Director of Admissions authorizing a second-tier presidential exception</li>
                                            <li>The second-tier presidential exception email is archived in the students scanned file.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <h3>Recruitment Materials and Presentations</h3>
                                        <p>GHC continually reviews and updates its recruiting materials to ensure accurate representation of the College's programs, practices, and policies. The College <span class="ws">Catalog <a href="evidence/10.5/GHC-Catalog.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[5] GHC-Catalog">[5]</a></span> is the primary source for publishing information about the College's programs, practices, and policies. Annual editions are available in print and online. As programs and policies change mid-year, those changes are published on the applicable webpage of GHC's website and announced in a daily newsletter, GHC Inform. Deans, Chairs, and program directors communicate any changes in policy or practice directly with the recruitment team, the Orientation leaders, and the Advising department through regular communication with the Office of Enrollment Management. Key stakeholders in this area of the College meet monthly as the Enrollment Management Action Team. All members of the institution are invited to monthly online town-hall forums to discuss changes to policy or other key pieces of practices and policies as they relate to recruitment, retention, and graduation efforts.</p>

                                        <p>The Executive Director of Institutional Advancement is responsible for the logistics of training recruiters to establish and maintain school and community contacts, manage event scheduling, and coordinate activities with campus deans, advisors, and individual schools of the College. Additionally, recruiters work closely with Admissions, the Registrar's Office, Financial Aid, and Student Support Services to understand the GHC student onboarding process. GHC's recruiting footprint follows the mission of the College to serve a diverse population in Northwest Georgia. Recruiters cover the following territories:</p>
