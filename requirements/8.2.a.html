                                        <p>Georgia Highlands College (GHC) identifies expected outcomes, assesses the extent to which it achieves these outcomes, and provides evidence of seeking improvement based on analysis, interpretation, and most importantly, actions taken to continuously improve student learning for all degrees and programs.</p>

                                        <h3>Educational Programs Offered and Assessed</h3>
                                        <p>GHC is authorized to offer "pre-baccalaureate associate degree transfer programs, career associate degree programs, and targeted baccalaureate degree programs" by the Board of Regents (BOR) and University System of Georgia (USG) (GHC Mission <a href="evidence/8.2.a/GHC-MissionandGoals.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[1] GHC-MissionandGoals">[1]</a>). </p>

                                        <p>GHC offers three career associate programs (Associate of Nursing, Associate of Dental Hygiene, Associate of Human Services); two transfer associate programs (Associate of Arts, Associate of Science); one Nexus<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> associate degree (FinTech); and eight baccalaureate degree programs (Bachelor of Business Administration Healthcare Management, Bachelor of Business Administration Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Bachelor of Science with a Major in Building Information Modeling Management, Bachelor of Science with a Major in Health Science, Bachelor of Science with a Major in Environmental and Natural Resources, Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, RN to BSN).

                                        <h3>Program Assessment of Student Learning and Improvement </h3>
                                        <p>GHC assesses student learning on an annual basis. Academic deans, division chairs, and teaching faculty play a central role in all aspects of the educational program assessment process: the establishment of student learning outcomes, the development of assessment plans, the conduct of assessment, assessment reporting, the review of assessment reports, and the use of assessment findings to make program improvements. Since the Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, Nexus Associate in Supply Chain in Financial Technology, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing, RN to BSN educational programs are offered via USG cooperative academic arrangements. PLOs are established at the consortia level with deep faculty involvement. The identified program learning outcomes for each academic program is presented in Table 1.</p>

                                        <h4>PLO Maps</h4>
                                        <p>For each academic program, faculty have identified and aligned courses in the curricula where student learning outcomes are introduced, reinforced, and demonstrated. Embedded assignments, projects, and activities in the demonstration courses allow each program to focus on how well students have mastered each program learning outcome. The Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice and the Nexus Associate in Supply Chain in Financial Technology programs are offered via USG cooperative academic arrangements. Therefore, the PLO maps for those programs are established at the consortia level and utilize a different format. The curriculum maps for each program have been provided in Table 2.</p>

                                        <h4>Annual Reports and Use of Data for Continuous Improvement </h4>
                                        <p>Raw assessment data for each program is maintained by the program. Annual reports that provide updates on the assessment work from the previous year, describe the data collected for the current assessment cycle, report the findings, and describe recommendations for improvement based on the data are submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs. Ongoing assessment is a continuous process at GHC with three factors determining the type of assessment activities that programs engage in each year.</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Three of GHC's academic programs are accredited or approved by outside agencies. GHC's Associate of Science in Nursing and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree programs are nationally accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN). GHC's Dental Hygiene Associate degree is accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Their ongoing assessment is conducted via ACEN and CODA reporting mechanisms. </li>
                                            <li>Programs offered via cooperative academic agreements, such as the Nexus Associate in Supply Chain in Financial Technology and Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, are assessed via the methods agreed upon by members institutions. Assessments commonly involves an annual review of programmatic outcomes and reporting back to the institutions who are party to the agreement. Annual program reviews may utilize a different format.</li>
                                            <li>Academic programs which are not accredited by an outside accrediting agency or part of a cooperative academic agreement participate in institutional processes for program assessment of student learning outcomes and improvement based on review of these data annually.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p>The ongoing academic program review process at GHC requires that programs utilize an established means of assessment to collect assessment data to measure student success for each of the program's learning outcomes. The data must be analyzed and the findings used to make improvements to the program and student learning. The status of the proposed improvements is reported in the annual report for the next academic year. Table 3 provides examples pulled from the program improvement reports for each academic program of data that was collected and how it was used for improvement for the last three years. The following summaries were generated from program review reports over the past three years which demonstrate institutional compliance with the three principal elements of Standard 8.2.a. in each of GHC's fourteen educational programs.</p>
