                                        <p>Georgia Highlands College (GHC) publishes an appropriate and clear procedure for addressing written student complaints, follows the policy when resolving complaints, and maintains a record of student complaints that can be accessed by SACSCOC upon request.</p>

                                        <p>GHC strives to provide an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and personal growth and understands the importance of providing students with a fair and equitable process for resolving complaints. To that end, the college provides a variety of mechanisms for students to bring forward a range of complaints. Commonly, the college attempts to resolve disputes at the lowest level possible. However, there is a formalized and written process students may also utilize. As a college, GHC is committed to the equal treatment of all students. The primary goals and objectives of the student compliant procedure at the college are to ensure that student concerns are promptly addressed and resolved in a fair and judicious manner. </p>

                                        <h3>Published Policies and Procedures for Written Complaints </h3>
                                        <p>Procedures for addressing written student complaints are outlined in the General <span class="ws">Catalog <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-Catalog.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[1] GHC-Catalog">[1]</a>,</span> Student <span class="ws">Handbook <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-StudentHandbook.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[2] GHC-StudentHandbook">[2]</a>,</span> and on GHC website under Students Rights &amp; <span class="ws">Responsibilities <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-StudentRightsandResponsibilities.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[3] GHC-StudentRightsandResposibilities">[3]</a>.</span> Students may submit written student complaints for:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Student Grievances and Complaints </li>

                                        <p>All student complaints are referred to and tracked by the Assistant Vice President of Academic Retention and Resources (AVPARR). The AVPARR serves as monitor for the compliant process and does not make decisions outside the scope of their area of authority. Instead, the AVPARR serves as an advisor to the student through the complaint process. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Student Grievances and Complaints</strong>. Students at GHC may file a grievance resulting from a decision reached or action taken by a faculty or staff member acting in the course of official duty or a general complaint regarding their college experience. All students have the right to file a grievance or complaint. However, academic integrity, grade appeal policies, and sexual harassment are covered under separate policies. The steps involved in a written grievance or complaint are outlined in the college's policies and procedures <span class="ws">manual <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-PolicyandProceduresManual.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[4] GHC-PolicyandProceduresManual">[4]</a></span> and include: </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Filing a written complaint via the student grievance and complaint form explaining the situation. The form will be sent to the appropriate academic dean or supervisor. </li>
                                            <li>The appropriate academic dean or supervisor will contact notify the student of the receipt of the complaint within five working days. </li>
                                            <li>Within fifteen working days of receipt of the written request, the academic dean or supervisor will hold a conference with the student and employee. </li>
                                            <li>If mutual satisfaction is not reached following this conference, an appeal can be made in writing to the appropriate vice president or faculty grievance committee, whose decision will be final. All documentation should be forwarded to the vice president or faculty grievance committee.</li>
                                            <li>Appeals must be made in writing to the college President within 10 calendar days of decision. The President's decision in a formal grievance matter may be appealed to the Board of Regents in accordance with Section 4.7 of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents of the University of Georgia.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p><strong>Ethics and Compliance Reporting Hotline</strong>. Students who wish to utilize an alternative reporting system outside of the grievance and complaint form may submit their concerns via the ethics and compliance reporting hotline. The hotline is prominently published on the GHC <span class="ws">website <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-EthicsandComplaintHotline.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[5] GHC-EthicsandComplaintHotline">[5]</a>.</span> It is not intended to replace the existing channels of communication but does provide an element of anonymity and oversight. Reports made via the ethics and compliance hotline are directed to the Chief Human Resources Officer who works to resolve the complaint or refer it to the appropriate office for investigation and resolution. Ethics and compliance reports and their resolutions are maintained by the Office of Human Resources.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Title IX</strong>. GHC prohibits specific forms of behavior that violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. GHC will not tolerate sexual misconduct, which is prohibited, and which includes, but is not limited to, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, and stalking. To that end, the college maintains a Title IX program that is designed to ensure university compliance with Title IX. Detailed information about GHC's Title IX process can be found on the college's <span class="ws">website <a href="evidence/12.4/GHC-TitleIX.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[6] GHC-TitleIX">[6]</a>.</span> All student Title IX reports are handled by the AVPARR, who serves as the Title IX coordinator. The specific process and procedure are governed by the Board of Regents (BOR) Sexual Misconduct <span class="ws">Policy <a href="evidence/12.4/BOR-Policy-6-7.pdf" target="_blank"  data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[7] BOR-Policy-6.7">[7]</a>.</span></p>

                                        <p><strong>Grade Appeals</strong>. Students who disagree with the final grade in a course can file a grade appeal. As noted previously, students are first encouraged to discuss the matter with their faculty member at the departmental level. The faculty member is required to provide a written statement to the student explaining their decision. Failing an inadequate resolution, the student may appeal via a formalized process before the mid-term date the following semester. The steps involved in a grade appeal are outlined in the college's policies and procedures manual and include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Contacting the faculty member in writing to explain the dispute and grade they believed they should have earned. The faculty member will investigate and provide a written statement back to the student.</li>
                                            <li>If this resolution is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, they may appeal to the academic dean in writing with the faculty member's written statement. The
                                            <li>ademic dean will investigate and provide a written statement back to the student.</li>
                                            <li>If this resolution is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, they may appeal to the provost in writing with the faculty member's and academic dean's written statements. The Provost's Office has the option to appoint an appeal review committee.</li>
                                            <li>If the student is still dissatisfied with the decision, they may appeal to the president of the college by sending all previous documentation to the president's office. The decision of the president is final.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Student Code of Conduct Appeals. Students who are found in violation of the student code of conduct may appeal the decision on the grounds of a procedural error, substantive error, or new evidence. The steps involved in a student code of conduct appeal are outlined in the college's policies and procedures manual and include:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Receiving the decision of the student conduct officer or panel and appealing within five working days to the provost.</li>
                                            <li>The provost or designee will receive a written transcript or summary of the proceedings and will appoint a committee of three faculty/staff members for Code of Conduct cases or use an existing committee if appropriate.</li>
                                            <li>The committee shall review the facts and circumstances of the case. The committee shall within five (5) working days submit a recommendation to the provost or a designee. The appeals committee may recommend overturning the decision of the hearing officer or panel or may modify the sanction, but not increase the severity of the sanction.</li>
                                            <li>Once the appeals process is completed, the provost or designee shall render a decision within five (5) working days.</li>
                                            <li>A student may appeal the decision of the provost or designee to the president of the college within five (5) working days of issuance in written form.</li>
                                            <li>Once all appeals have been exhausted at the institutional level a student may appeal in writing to the executive secretary of the Board of Regents, who may review the appeal at their discretion.</li>
                                        </ol>
