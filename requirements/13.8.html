The Campus Safety office shall immediately consult with the president regarding the emergency and the possible need for a declaration of a campus state of emergency." </p> 

 

<h3>Emergency Response Notifications </h3> 

<p>Georgia Highlands College maintains an Emergency Communications <span class="ws">Plan <a href="evidence/13.8/GHC-EmergencyCommunicationsPlan.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[7] GHC-EmergencyCommunicationsPlan">[7]</a></span> where the Marketing and Communications Office bears the primary responsibility to safeguard the college's public image and ensure a proper mechanism for campus safety and security in an emergency event. The ECP primary purpose is to outline the proper processes, procedures and policies relating to emergency events.  The plan details Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) for each location, emphasizes responsibilities to each administrator as well as detailing communications and coordination protocols with local Police and Sheriff's department. GHC believes key to addressing a crisis is timely communication with internal constituents such as faculty, staff and students, as well as with the media and the public. Therefore, as soon as a crisis as identified: </p>

<ul>
   <li>The president and the college relations officer should be notified of any emergency, regardless of the time or day. </li>
    
    <li>The magnitude and possible consequences of the crisis will be assessed by the president, college relations officer and safety personnel.					 </li>
    
    <li>The president or the college relations officer will be the sole spokesman. </li>
    
    <li>The vice presidents and campus dean(s) will then be notified and apprised of the situation. </li>
    </ul>

 

<p>GHC also uses the Notify <span class="ws">System <a href="evidence/13.8/GHC-Notify.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[8] GHC-Notify">[8]</a></span> as the fastest form of warning concerning emergency notifications. During class registration, students are automatically enrolled in this system and faculty/staff are encouraged to voluntarily opt-in to the notification system. The President can determine college wide delays, closures, or other safety related events through the Notify System. Additional notifications are also broadcast primarily through WXIA 11 ALIVE (Atlanta) news station. GHC internal email is used to deliver weather notifications and other related data as information to severe weather events. </p>  

 

<p>The most recent example of testing the Emergency Communications Plan occurred in July 2022.  A bomb threat was called initially specifying the Marietta Instructional Site as the location of peril. The 911 call came to Marietta City Police Department, which dispatched officers to facilitate evacuations from the site. GHC Police were contacted and GHC leadership were notified. In accordance with the ECP, the President closed the college while Marketing and Communications dispatched communications to the institution through GHC Alert/Inform, email, and a notification banner on the college website. Marketing and Communications also dispatched closure notifications to local media outlets.  </p>

 

<h3>Facilities and Grounds </h3>

<p>Facilities and grounds are regularly reviewed and tested for health and safety concerns through routine inspection by campus safety and the Department of Facilities.

In the process of safety and maintenance, the department uses a variety of measures. Their mission also states that facilities will "work closely with all other departments to provide the physical environment conducive to the highest excellence in teaching and learning." To facilitate this mission, the department maintains requests are submitted and tracked via the QWARE system and assures the security of offices and buildings via a Key Request system form and Alarm Code Request form.
