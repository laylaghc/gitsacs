                                        <p>Georgia Highlands College, a state college in the University System of Georgia (USG), identifies, evaluates and publishes goals and outcomes for student achievement appropriate to the College's mission, the nature of the students it serves, and the kinds of programs offered. GHC uses multiple measures to document student success. These include:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>One Year Retention Rates for First-Time, Full-Time students</li>
                                            <li>Degrees Conferred</li>
                                            <li>3-Year Graduation Rates for Associate Degree programs</li>
                                            <li>Gateway Course Success Rates</li>
                                            <li>National Council Licensure Exam Pass Rates</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p>SACSCOC requested its member institutions identify a student completion metric. GHC selected the IPEDS 150% Graduation Rate for Associate Degree programs. This rate is published with selected demographics and with the other student achievement metrics, on the Georgia Highlands College Website. These metrics were all chosen based on their accessibility through reporting systems such as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), The National Student Clearinghouse, and data dashboards provided by the USG Board of Regents (BOR). These metrics also align with at least one part of the GHC mission or strategic plan, as well as providing a focus for the institutional function and the type of students we serve.</p>

                                        <p>In addition to the College's mission statement, the BOR and USG certain their expectations of the mission of a state college. Specifically: </p>
                                        <blockquote>Institutions included in the balanced bachelor's and associate-level state colleges group offer bachelor's degrees, associate degree programs, and general education courses, but no graduate programs. These state colleges are characterized as balanced bachelor's and associate-level degrees with bachelor's programs focused on specialized academic and economic development program areas and regional, college-educated workforce needs. The Nexus degree can be offered at state colleges. The emphasis at these state colleges is on teaching and service with limited focus on basic or applied research <span class="ws">activity. <a href="evidence/8.1/BOR-Policy-2.8.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[2] BOR-Policy-2.8">[2]</a></span>

                                        <p>To assist in accomplishing this mission, the College developed a <span class="ws">Strategic Plan <a href="evidence/8.1/GHC-StrategicPlan.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[3] GHC-StrategicPlan">[3]</a></span> with four strategic priorities. Those strategic priorities include:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong><u>Access and Opportunity</u></strong>: GHC will provide access and opportunities to high-quality academic programs by focusing on comprehensive enrollment management processes and employee recruitment and retention processes across the institution.</li>
                                            <li><strong><u>Inclusivity and Engagement</u></strong>: GHC will engage with our communities to ensure the College meets the needs as a state college and to meet the needs of those diverse communities by being inclusive in all that the College does.</li>
                                            <li><strong><u>Student Success</u></strong>: GHC will provide services that support student success across all modalities, programs, and courses.</li>
                                            <li><strong><u>Efficiency and Effectiveness</u></strong>: GHC will create and maintain a culture of continuous improvement allowing GHC to maintain low tuition and fees while increasing services to students to support academic achievement.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p>The students that are served by GHC reflect this function in that they are mostly part-time and enrolled in associate degree programs. GHC is committed to providing students with the services and programs they need to be successful in completing their programs of study to either move on and pursue a higher degree or enter the workforce. The student achievement metrics selected by the college reflect this commitment by focusing on the mission, the types of programs offered by the college, and the nature of the students served at the institution.</p>
                                        Metrics of student achievement are published on the College's webpage for the Institutional Effectiveness and Strategic Initiatives (IESI) department.

                                        <h3>Student Success Metrics</h3>

                                        <p>In the following section, GHC will provide a description of each of student success metric, threshold of acceptability, and pertinent data reflecting the institution's progress in meeting these goals.</p>

                                        <h4>Metric 1: One Year Retention Rates for Full-Time, First-Time Students</h4>


                                        <p><strong>Description</strong>. GHC monitors and records the retention rates for full-time first-time students and disaggregates by selected demographics variables such as gender and race or ethnicity. This allows the College to identify achievement gaps and begin to design and implement strategies to close those gaps. This metric was selected due to its connection to the GHC Strategic Initiatives of Access and Opportunity and Student Success. The metric is also an indicator of how the College is working toward the achievement of its access mission. The GHC rates are compared to the other state colleges in Georgia. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Threshold of Acceptability</strong>. The institutionally established minimum threshold for the one-year retention rate is to match the average for designated state colleges within the University System of Georgia (USG). A comparison with like institutions in USG gives the College a view of how similar student populations are achieving at similar colleges and provides a minimum target for its own student population. Additionally, the College has historically been at or above the average of USG state college retention rates. The institutional goal for this metric is to exceed the average for USG state colleges by 2%. GHC met the minimum threshold for this metric as well as exceeding the institutional goal in each of the last five years.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Pertinent Data</strong>. The three tables below demonstrate GHC's progress in exceeding the average for the USG state college sector in retention rates for first-time full-time students and reviews disaggregated by data gender and race/ethnicity. </p>

                                        <h4>Metric 2: Degrees Conferred </h4>

                                        <p><b>Description</b>. GHC monitors and reports the number of degrees conferred by the College every year. The College also looks at the degrees conferred by selected demographics such as gender, race or ethnicity, and type of degree. This allows the College to identify achievement gaps and to design and implement strategies to close those gaps. This metric aligns with GHC Strategic Initiatives 1 (Access and Opportunity) and 3 (Student Success). The metric is also an indicator of how the College is working toward the achievement of its stated mission to "provide access to …. pre-baccalaureate associate degree transfer programs, career associate degree programs, and targeted baccalaureate degree programs that meet the economic development needs of the region."</p>

                                        <p><b>Threshold of Acceptability</b>. The institutionally established minimum threshold for degrees conferred is to meet the five-year average of degrees conferred at the institution. The College has experienced fluctuation in enrollment and graduation and a five-year average of degrees conferred allows GHC to account for those fluctuations during the benchmarking and goal-setting process. GHC has established an institutional goal of exceeding the five-year average by 5%. While GHC met the institutionally established minimum threshold, the College did not achieve the stated goal for the most recent completed academic year.</p>

                                        <p><b>Pertinent Data</b>. The three tables below demonstrate GHC's progress in conferring degrees and reviews disaggregated by data gender and race/ethnicity. </p>

<h4>Metric 3: IPEDS 150% Graduation Rate</h4>

<p><b>Description</b>. GHC monitors and reports the 150% graduation rate of those seeking degrees as published on the IPEDS data feedback report. The rate is also disaggregated by gender, race/ethnicity, and Pell grant eligibility. The College also compares this metric with the state college average for the 150% rate. This metric was selected by the College as its SACSCOC requested student completion metric. Additionally, the IPEDS 150% Graduation Rate aligns with the GHC Strategic Plan Initiative number 3 (Student Success). This metric also connects with efforts to assist the College in achieving its mission. </p>

<p><b>Threshold of Acceptability</b>. The institutionally established minimum threshold for this metric is to meet the institutional rate from the previous year. This threshold encourages continuous improvement of the rate while allowing for fluctuations in enrollment and degrees conferred. The goal for this metric is to meet or exceed the state college average of the IPEDS 150% graduation rate. The College has met the minimum threshold in each of the last 5 years but has failed to meet the institutional goal.</p>

<p><b>Pertinent Data</b>. The three tables below demonstrate GHC's status in striving to meet the institution's IPEDS 150% graduation rate goal and reviews disaggregated by data gender and race/ethnicity. </p>

<h4>Metric 4: Gateway Course Success Rates </h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>. Georgia Highlands College monitors and reports the successful completion of selected courses as a metric of student success. The courses selected for this metric include ENGL 1101: English Composition I, MATH 1001: Quantitative Reasoning, MATH 1111: College Algebra, and MATH/STAT 1401: Elementary Statistics. These courses were chosen because they are considered "gateway" or entry courses. An examination of success rates for these courses can provide the College with information on how new students are doing in the early stages of their academic career. This metric can also inform and support findings and provide additional context in the retention and completion metrics. This metric aligns with the mission of the College and Strategic Initiative 3 (Student Success). </p>

<p><strong>Threshold of Acceptability</strong>. The minimum threshold for gateway course success rate is 64% for all courses combined. This baseline was set by examining the College's performance in this metric and taking an average of several years of data. The institutional goal for gateway course success rates is to exceed the minimum threshold by 2% or greater. GHC met the minimum threshold in the most recently completed academic year but did not meet the institutional goal for this metric.</p>

<p><strong>Pertinent Data</strong>. The table below demonstrates GHC's status in striving to improve gateway course success rates.</p>

<h4>Metric 5: National Council Licensure Exam (NCLEX) Exam Pass Rates</h4>

<p><strong>Description</strong>. GHC monitors and reports student pass rates on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). Licensure and board examinations are strong metrics of student success and completion that align with the GHC mission to "provide access to excellent educational opportunities" and to "meet the economic development needs of the region." </p>

<p><strong>Threshold of Acceptability</strong>. The minimum threshold for NCLEX is to meet the pass rate for students in the state of Georgia. By establishing this as the minimum threshold, the College will be able to compare how well it prepares its nursing students to the rest of the state. For the most recently completed year, the pass rate for the NCLEX in the state of Georgia is 82.58%. The institutional goal for pass rate of the NCLEX at GHC is to exceed the minimum threshold by 5%. The College met the minimum threshold but failed to achieve its target of 5% above the threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Pertinent Data</strong>. The table below demonstrates GHC student NCLUX pass rates in 2020, 2021, and 2022. </p>
