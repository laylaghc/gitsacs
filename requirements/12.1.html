As a state college, GHC provides appropriate academic and student support programs, services, and activities consistent with its mission. </p>

                                        <h3>GHC's Access Mission</h3>
                                        <p>The mission statement of GHC is as follows: </p>
                                        <blockquote>The mission of Georgia Highlands College, a state college of the University System of Georgia, is to provide access to excellent educational opportunities for the intellectual, cultural, and physical development of a diverse population through pre-baccalaureate associate degree transfer programs, career associate degree programs, and targeted baccalaureate degree programs that meet the economic development needs of the <span class="ws">region <a href="evidence/12.1/GHC-MissionandGoals.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[1] GHC-MissionandGoals">[1]</a></span>.</blockquote>

                                        <p>In addition to the College's mission statement, the BOR and USG describe expectations of the mission of a state college. Specifically: </p>
                                        <blockquote>Institutions included in the balanced bachelor's and associate-level state colleges group offer bachelor's degrees, associate programs, and general education courses, but no graduate programs. These state colleges are characterized as balanced bachelor's and associate-level degrees with bachelor's programs focused on specialized academic and economic development program areas and regional, college-educated workforce needs. The Nexus degree can be offered at state colleges. The emphasis at these state colleges is on teaching and service with limited focus on basic or applied research activity <span class="ws">(BOR 2.8 <a href="evidence/12.1/BOR-Policy-2.8.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[2] BOR-Policy-2.8">[2]</a>)</span>. </blockquote>

                                        <h4>Advising</h4>
                                        <p>Advising at GHC is the focus of the institution's QEP. As such, a fuller description of the services provided by advising can be found in the QEP Impact Report. As a college, GHC considers advising an essential activity to promote overall intellectual, cultural, and physical development. Both professional advisors and faculty members engage in advising and helping guide students in their educational journey at GHC, from start to finish, from organizing and running orientations to helping celebrate graduation. GHC defines advising as a process that occurs throughout the academic year, not just during designated course selection and registration periods. </p>

                                        <h4>Auxiliary Services </h4>
                                        <p>Auxiliary Services operates under the Division of Finance and Administration and includes the bookstore, campus dining, vending services, parking, and printing/copying services. While providing all these services, the Department focuses especially on keeping costs low for GHC students, thus contributing to the access component of the college's mission. The bookstore, for example, offers items such as textbooks, school supplies, spirit wear, and technology, all at competitive prices. Bookstore personnel also distribute the textbooks, free of charge, to dual enrollment students. A similar commitment to ensuring access and affordability is found across the Department's culture. </p>

                                        <h4>Campus Assessment, Response, and Evaluation (CARE) Team and Early Alert</h4>
                                        <p>Consistent with the mission of the college of promoting access to excellent educational opportunities and providing support for students who might struggle in the college, GHC operates a CARE team and Early Alert system to better support students. The process for both systems is noted on the College's <span class="ws">website <a href="evidence/12.1/GHC-Website-Main.pdf" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="[3] GHC-Website-Main">[3]</a>.</span> </p>

                                        <p><strong>CARE Team</strong>. The GHC CARE Team responds to notices of students who are distressed or exhibit questionable behavior(s). Once a CARE ticket is received, it is promptly screened by the inter-departmental CARE Team. The response is based on the level of severity indicated on the ticket and interventions may be put into place to promote student and campus safety. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Early Alert</strong>. Via the Early Alert system, faculty can raise an alert to notify the student's advisor and appropriate support team regarding academic performance or a general concern. These support teams (tutoring, counseling, advising, etc.) reach out to the student and encourage participation in the noted support. </p>
